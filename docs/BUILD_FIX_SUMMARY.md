# Build Fix Summary - Vercel Deployment

## Issue
The Vercel build was failing with ESLint errors because test files were being included in the Next.js build process, causing `no-undef` errors for Jest globals (`describe`, `it`, `expect`).

## Root Cause
- Test files in `__tests__` directories and `*.test.ts(x)` files were being linted during the build
- Jest globals were not recognized because the test environment wasn't configured for ESLint
- Several unused variables were triggering warnings that failed the build

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created `.eslintignore` file
Explicitly excludes test files from ESLint during builds:
- `**/__tests__/**`
- `**/*.test.ts`
- `**/*.test.tsx`
- `**/*.spec.ts`
- `**/*.spec.tsx`

### 2. Updated `.eslintrc.json`
Added Jest environment configuration for test files:
```json
"overrides": [
  {
    "files": ["**/__tests__/**/*.[jt]s?(x)", "**/?(*.)+(spec|test).[jt]s?(x)"],
    "env": {
      "jest": true
    }
  }
]
```

### 3. Updated `tsconfig.json`
Excluded test files from TypeScript compilation:
```json
"exclude": ["node_modules", "**/__tests__/**", "**/*.test.ts", "**/*.test.tsx", "**/*.spec.ts", "**/*.spec.tsx"]
```

### 4. Updated `next.config.js`
Added ESLint directory configuration to only lint production code:
```javascript
eslint: {
  ignoreDuringBuilds: false,
  dirs: ['src/app', 'src/components', 'src/lib', 'src/utils', 'src/contexts', 'src/hooks'],
}
```

### 5. Fixed Unused Variable Warnings
- `src/app/api/auth/verify-code/route.ts`: Changed `password` to `_password`
- `src/app/auth/verify/page.tsx`: Removed unused `signIn` import
- `src/lib/websocket.ts`: Prefixed unused parameters with underscore
- `src/types/next-auth.d.ts`: Removed unused `DefaultUser` import

## Result
✅ Test files are now properly excluded from the production build
✅ ESLint no longer fails on Jest globals in test files
✅ All unused variable warnings have been resolved
✅ Build should now succeed on Vercel

## Testing Locally
To verify the build works locally:
```bash
npm run build
```

This should complete without ESLint errors.

## Notes
- Test files can still be run with `npm test` - they're only excluded from the production build
- The `.eslintignore` file ensures test files are never linted during builds
- WebSocket warnings about `bufferutil` and `utf-8-validate` are expected and handled in webpack config
